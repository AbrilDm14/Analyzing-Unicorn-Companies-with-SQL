unicorn companies include 1) E-commerce & direct-to-consumer 2) Fintech and 3) Internet software & services.\n\nFor these industries, the average valuation has ranged over the years. However, we can conclude that:\n- E-commerce & direct-to-consumer: during the three years of observation the industry has created 75 unicorn companies, with an average valuation of $3.0 billion dollars. \n- Fintech: the industry has led to the creation of 173 unicorn companies, with a mean valuation of $4.6 billion dollars. \n- Internet software & services: during 2019-2021 there were 152 unicorn companies in the industry, with an average valuation of $3.5 billion dollars. \n\nFrom the top performing industries, Fintech has been the most outstanding one, as it has led to the highest number of unicorn companies created, as well as the one that has generated the highest average valuation. However, when investing, it might be a good idea to diversify the portfolio. This is why these three industries might be a good idea to focus on when the company structures their portfolio.
